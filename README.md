# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

##  Objective
Analyze and understand the Titanic dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## ðŸ›  Key Steps
- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, missing values)
- Plotted histograms and boxplots for key numeric features
- Created a correlation matrix and pairplot to study feature relationships
- Identified patterns, trends, and outliers
- Recorded observations on data distribution and correlations

##  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

##  Key Observations
- Fare has strong outliers.
- Age distribution is right-skewed.
- Pclass shows negative correlation with Fare and Survived.
- Higher fares and higher classes are associated with increased survival rates.
- SibSp and Parch show some positive correlation (family sizes).
